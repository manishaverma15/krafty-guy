            <p class="mb-4">Decades ago, as a little boy.. growing up in Karnal I started my tryst with this beautiful life.
              Born and brought up in a family that is a curious combination of modern and traditional values. These people are my  biggest support for the very fact that they always let me follow my heart's content.
              Looking back to my life and it's adolescent years, the most important thing I realize was my curiosity to know every little detail about the toys I had. I just love creating something out of nothing and that's where I realized choosing a career into creativity is something I exactly fit in.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Studying science was much a tradition in the clan and  then there's is this peer pressure, so I just got into it.
              Dutifully, i took up B.E. specializing in computer science. But soon after opting for B.tech I realized, i don't fit in there.
              As they say, it's never too late to follow your heart's content.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">I believe in a little saying that you either suit up well, go to your job, do what everyone else is doing.. or pave your own way, take risks, break stereotypes, swim upstream like a trout against norms and then whatever little that you achieve is yours.
              And so I have come up with opting this as my career. I believe in discovering something out of nothing and this business surely makes me feel that way.</p>
